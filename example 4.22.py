Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by
machines,
unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent
agents":
any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that
maximize its
chance of successfully achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the
term
"artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or
computers)
that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the
human mind,
such as "learning" and "problem solving".[4]
